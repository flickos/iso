## ðŸ§  Vision

> "An OS that teaches, empowers, and evolves."

FlickOS is more than just a toy OS â€” itâ€™s a platform for **learning**, **building**, and **exploring** the depths of computing. Inspired by the elegance of minimal Unix-like systems and the power of custom kernels, FlickOS is a hands-on journey into systems programming.
